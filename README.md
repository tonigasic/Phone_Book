# PhoneBook

It's a simple app that I made to practice my programming skils in C++.

## Getting Started

I used windows form's to create a nice design.

As you see on the screenshot I have a few functionalities like adding removing and updating people in my phone book.

I also implemented different relationships in which you can put people so it's easyer to search for them.

You can also search them by ID, Name, Surname, Phone or city or you can just click Select All and see all the people you have in your phone book.

By clicking the GO button you get the labels for ID,Name,Surname,Phone and city filled with the data of the person on which you clicked.
